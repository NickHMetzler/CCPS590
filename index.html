			<h2>What is this webpage about?</h2>
			<p>On this page there will be information on the Alfa Romeo Giulia and it's many variants.<br>It is my belief that this car is one of the most beautiful sedans of the modern era of vehicles. <br>Alfa Romeo being a coach maker for over a century, they have refined their design and delivered a driving experience to rival the best.</p>

		<h3>Alfa Romeo Giulia 2.0T</h3>
	</div>
	<div class="row">
		<div class="col-md-4">
			<p>This is the base model Alfa Romeo Giulia, which can be purchased at an MSRP of around $40,000CDN. This model is what all trim levels of the Giulia are based on up until the famous Quadrifoglio.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="col-md-4">
			<p>It is powered by a 2.0l turbocharged inline 4, and makes 280hp. As can be seen on the image below this car is in the color Rosso Alfa, Alfa Romeo's signature color. This option costs an extra $1000CDN on top of the base price of the car for all models.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="col-md-4">
			<p>This specific model only comes in a Rear Wheel Drive drivetrain, which is great for a sports car, however is not ideal for an all weather situation such as snow in Canada.</p>

		<div class="col-md-4">
			<p>This trim level of the Giulia is a step up from the Base Model, and can be purchased at an MSRP of around $60,000CDN.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="col-md-4">
			<p>Some differences that can be seen immediatley are the Alfa Romeo Signature Rims and more aggressive body styling in the bumpers of the car. This trim level also includes full time All Wheel Drive, which allows the car to handle exceptionally in all types of weather.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="col-md-4">
			<p>This trim level can also be outfitted with a panoramic sunroof, heated seats/steering wheel, and a bluetooth system which includes Android Auto. In my opinion this is the perfect model for the average Canadian.</p>

		<h3>Alfa Romeo Giulia Quadrifoglio</h3>
	</div>
	<div class="row">
		<div class="col-md-4">
			<p>This trim level of Giulia shares little DNA with it's cheaper siblings, and can be purchased at an MSRP of around $120,000CDN.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="col-md-4">
			<p>This variant was meant to be a true drivers car, for someone who's a racing enthusiast and wants to test the limit of their driving. It features a Carbon Fibre construction, and no option of creature comforts that the Ti Sport may include. With a 3.0l Turbocharged Ferrari designed V6 under the hood, this car is good for making 505hp, and can accelerate to 100km/h in just under 3.9 seconds.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="col-md-4">
			<p>The Quadrifoglio also includes much more aggressive styling, with active cooling to the engine, and a carbon fibre lip on the boot. A distinct way to tell a Quadrifoglio from other variants is the four leaf clover badge (Quadrifoglio means four leaves in italian) proudly displayed on each of the front fenders. This car is not for the faint of heart, and would be a terrible all weather car with that amount of power to the rear wheels.</p>

		<div class="col-md-4">
			<p>This Giulia is perhaps the craziest of them all, and can be purchased at an MSRP of a whopping $260,000CDN. And with that price tag it's a rare find on the roads.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="col-md-4">
			<p>This variant is an absolute monster named the GTAm (Gran Turismo Alleggerita). It was designed from the ground up to be a through and through racecar. From crazy aero styling to the huge spoiler, this is a true driving machine. It, like the Quadrifoflio, also features a Carbon Fibre construction, and no option of creature comforts.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="col-md-4">
			<p>With a 2.9l Turbocharged Ferrari designed V6 under the hood, this car is good for making a whopping 540hp, and can accelerate to 100km/h in a mind boggling 3.6 seconds.</p>
